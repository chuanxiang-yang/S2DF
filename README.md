  In this paper, we propose the scaled-squared distance function (S<sup>2</sup>DF), a novel implicit surface representation for modeling arbitrary surface types. S<sup>2</sup>DF does not distinguish between inside and outside regions while effectively addressing the non-differentiability issue of UDF at the zero level set. We demonstrate that S<sup>2</sup>DF satisfies a second-order partial differential equation of Monge-Ampere-type, allowing us to develop a learning pipeline that leverages a novel Monge-Ampere regularization to directly learn S<sup>2</sup>DF from raw unoriented point clouds without supervision from ground-truth S<sup>2</sup>DF values.
